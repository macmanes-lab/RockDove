## Creating markers for sexing Rock Doves. 
This is apparently been a little bit of a problem. 

#### Step 1. 
Identify the putative W in *Columba livia* genome. I downloaded the chicken W and blasted it to the *C. livia* genome. It returned a 2.xMb scaffold236, 
which seems likely to be the W in our species. 

#### Step 2
I blasted the transcriptome assembly to the putative chrW, to generate a list of chrW genes - there were 40 of these.

#### Step 3
I looked at patterns of expression - these genes if really on the W shold be only expressed in the female birds. There were several of these that 
looked promising, but only 2 that had very perfectly matching patterns of expression AND high similarity to *C. livia* putative chrW. These genes are
